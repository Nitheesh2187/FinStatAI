# Level 1:

Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes mutual funds that have quoted price. The mutual funds are valued using the closing NAV.

# Level 2:

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

# Level 3:

If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. There are no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the year. The Company’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels at the end of the reporting period.

# (ii) Valuation technique used to determine fair value

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:

- the use of quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments
- the fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted analysis (if any).

# Financial Risk Management

The Company’s Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s risk management framework.

The Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities.

# (A) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of incurring a loss that may arise from a borrower or debtor failing to make required payments. Credit risk arises mainly from outstanding receivables from free market dealers, cash and cash equivalents, employee advances and security deposits. The Company manages and analyses the credit risk for each of its new clients before standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered.

# (i) Credit risk management

The Company’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer and including the default risk of the industry, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

The Company considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis through each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk the Company compares the risk of default occurring on asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information such as:

- i) Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business;
- ii) Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the counterparty;
- iii) Financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the counterparty’s ability to meet its obligations;
- iv) Significant increase in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same counterparty;
- v) Significant changes in the value of the collateral supporting the obligation or in the quality of the third-party guarantees or credit enhancements.

Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectations of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the Company. Where loans or receivables have been written off, the Company continues to engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognized as income in the statement of profit and loss.

For trade receivables, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 Financial Instrument, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognized from initial recognition of the receivables. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating expected credit losses (ECL), the Company considers reasonable and relevant information that is available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Company’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward looking information.
